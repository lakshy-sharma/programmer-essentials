# Programmer Essentials

This repository was created by me as a place where I could share my fun side projects.
It is a place where I share the fun projects I buuild and some random software project ideas I come up with.
Hence it is not a place where you might find all folders containing some useful code. 

The main goal of these projects is to be small enough to be called utilities instead of projects. 
These utilities are focussed towards aiding software developers in doing their daily jobs.
I encourage other developers to contribute in this project with their suggestions and use this as ground to show their creativity using new languages such as Golang and Rust.

## Projects

### Active
1. Matrix: A Network Diagnostics Tool written in Golang.
2. Refurnish: A File Operations Tool written in Rust. (Work in progress)
3. Spine: A simple load balancer written in golang.

### Ideas
1. Erase: A tool to provide rm like functionality with more features.
2. Apprentice: Yet another attempt at AI based virtual assistant.
